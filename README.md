# simple-encryption
An archive of my custom simple text encryption scripts, many of these of simply python code that utilize common encryption algorithms.

These were all optimized with ChatGPT! Which was originally a disaster with GPT 3.5 so I almost gave up using AI with this project, then I tried GPT 4 and it was much better and many less issues I had to fix afterwards.
